## 📖 What is LitMap?

LitMap is designed to bridge the gap between literature and real-life settings, giving readers and travelers another way to connect with books. Users can explore the world map to find the cities, towns, and landmarks that serve as settings in well-known (and lesser-known) books. Each location includes information about the book, author, and the setting's significance.

### Key Features

- **Global Map Exploration**: Discover settings from books worldwide on an interactive map.
- **Search & Filter**: Easily search for books by title, author, genre, and tags.
- **Contribute to the Map**: Add new books and their associated locations, making LitMap a growing repository of literary landmarks.
- **Responsive & User-Friendly**: An intuitive interface with map controls for zoom, map type selection, and quick navigation.
