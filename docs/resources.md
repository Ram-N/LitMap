# Open Library API

Open Library does provide book covers through its API. They store and display cover images for many of their books, which can be accessed programmatically via the API. The covers are available in different sizes (small, medium, large) and can be retrieved using the book's ISBN, OCLC number, or Open Library ID.

You can access these images via URLs in the format:
https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/{cover_id}-{size}.jpg, where cover_id is the specific ID for the book cover, and size can be S, M, or L.
