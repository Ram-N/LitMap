I use a streamlit app (run locally) to update the fireStore DB that stores all the data for LitMap.

```
streamlit run main.py
```

# Coding Tasks Remaining


## New Dropdown fields needed
- Count the number of docs
- Duplicate related
- PURGE - write and delete
- BACKUP - Write all books to file


# Write the entire DB to a file
- spit out a JSON file



1. Add a new location to a book
2. Add a location description to a book

# Get and Print Functions

- When listing a book, write all its attributes...

## Handle Dupes
    - First reconcile the two books, giving the first ID all the good attributes.
    - Next Delete the second book, based on its ID.
    - verify that the book doesn't exist anymore.
