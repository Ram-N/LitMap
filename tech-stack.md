## File Descriptions


### 1. public/ Folder:
index.html: Your main HTML file that will load the map and interface for adding books. This is the root file that users will access.

- styles/:
    CSS Files

- scripts/:
    - app.js: Central JavaScript file for app logic. This will include UI interactions (handling form submissions, connecting Google Maps and Firebase).
    - firebase.js: Contains the Firebase configuration and initialization code. This is where you'll paste your Firebase config (from earlier).
    - map.js: Handles Google Maps logic, such as loading the map, adding markers, and interacting with map elements.

- assets/:
Place any images or icons your app might need here (like a logo, custom markers, etc.).

### 2. src/ Folder (optional):
    Use this folder if you plan to use a build tool like Webpack or Parcel.
components/: If you start building more advanced UI features (like modals, book lists, etc.), you can organize reusable components here.

-     utils/: Helper functions, like those for formatting data or handling Firebase queries, can go here.

### 3. Project Files:
- firebase.json & .firebaserc: 
    Auto-generated files to initialize Firebase in your project. Also contain hosting configurations.

- package.json: 
    This file tracks project dependencies (like Firebase SDK, if you're using npm).
